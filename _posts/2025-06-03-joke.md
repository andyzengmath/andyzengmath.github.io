Today, I went to the math department's town hall.

**Department Chair**: "Funny story—this year, the area that got its funding cut the most was analysis, because it's full of 'inequality.' Next was topology and geometry, since they're all studying 'homology' and 'homotopy' (sounds like 'homo')."

**Student A**: "Then how do they view representation theory?"
**Student B**: "So what's the safest thing to research now?"
**Student C**: "*Annihilated left radical ideals*."

(The humor plays on double meanings—"inequality" (social vs. mathematical), "homo" (homology/homotopy vs. slang for homosexuality), and the absurdly niche "annihilated left radical ideal" as a supposedly "safe" topic.)
