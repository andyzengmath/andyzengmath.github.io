I gave a talk *Elliptic Involutive Structures on Smooth Manifolds* at the **3rd Upstate New York Topology Seminar** at Syracuse University.

**Abstract**:
Elliptic Involutive Structures (EIS) are interpolations between two most important involutive
structures: complex structures and foliations. In this talk, we will define modules over EIS and
show equivalence of $\bar{\partial}$-coherent sheaves over EIS and cohesive modules introduced by J. Block,
and investigate how to use EIS to study the topology of smooth manifolds.
