**Abstract**:
We use Lie infinity groupoids and L infinity algebroids in studying higher structures arising in differential geometry. We study the homotopy coherent representations of  Lie infinity groupoids and L infinity algebroids, and apply them to (singular) foliations. Finally, we prove an A infinity version of de Rham theorem, and a higher Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for foliated infinity local systems.
