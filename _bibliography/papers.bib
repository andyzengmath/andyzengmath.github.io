  abstract={We study various problems arising in higher geometry using derived Lie $\infty$-groupoids and algebroids. We construct homotopical algebras for derived Lie $\infty$-groupoids and algebroids and study their homotopy-coherent representations. Then we apply these tools in studying singular foliations and their characteristic classes. Finally, we prove an $A_{\infty}$ de Rham theorem and higher Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for foliated manifolds.}

  abstract={This paper explores foliated differential graded algebras (dga) and their role in extending fundamental theorems of differential geometry to foliations. We establish an $A_{\infty}$ de Rham theorem for foliations, demonstrating that the classical quasi-isomorphism between singular cochains and de Rham forms lifts to an $A_{\infty}$ quasi-isomorphism in the foliated setting.  Furthermore, we investigate the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for foliations, building upon the established higher Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for manifolds. By constructing an integration functor, we prove a higher Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for foliations, revealing an equivalence between $\infty$-representations of $L_{\infty}$-algebroids and $\infty$-representations of Lie $\infty$-groupoids within the context of foliations. This work generalizes the classical Riemann-Hilbert correspondence to foliations, providing a deeper understanding of the relationship between representations of Lie algebroids and Lie groupoids in this framework.}

  abstract={We apply sentiment analysis in financial context using FinBERT, and build a deep neural network model based on LSTM to predict the movement of financial market movement. We apply this model on stock news dataset, and compare its effectiveness to BERT, LSTM and classical ARIMA model. We find that sentiment is an effective factor in predicting market movement. We also propose several method to improve the model.}
