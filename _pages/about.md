<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
 I am a *Visiting Research Scholar* affiliated with [Penn Mathematics](https://www.math.upenn.edu) and Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS), and a *Research Scientist* working on Genararive AI, Large Language Models (LLM), and Reinforcement Learning. I got my Ph.D in Mathematics from [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu) and M.A.St. in Pure Mathematics at [Churchill College](https://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk). I also have multiple  graduate and undergraduate degrees in Economics, Computer Science, and Applied Mathematics.

 My primary interest lies in (derived) higher differential geometry which is the study of an $(\infty,1)$-topos into which standard differential geometry faithfully embeds. In particular, I work on homotopy theory of $L_{\infty}-algebroids$ and Lie $\infty$-groupoids. Topics I find fascinating also include index theory, K-theory, and mathematical physics.

 I am also interested various topics in AI and Machine Learning, in particular, Reinforcement Learning, Geometric Deep Learning, Graph Representation Learning etc. I have been working on multiple Generative AI and LLM applications, including Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL), Orchestration, LLM evaluation etc.
