## Current Teaching

### Math 601 Algebraic Topology (Spring 2020)
**Instructor:** *Prof. Herman Gluck*

**Course description**: Covering spaces and fundamental groups, van Kampen's theorem and classification of surfaces. Basics of homology and cohomology, singular and cellular; isomorphism with de Rham cohomology. Brouwer fixed point theorem, CW complexes, cup and cap products, Poincare duality, Kunneth and universal coefficient theorems, Alexander duality, Lefschetz fixed point theorem.

**Office lolation**: DRL 3C15

**Homework solutions/comments:**
[Homework 2 Covering spaces](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~qze/math601s20/hw2.pdf)

[Homework 3](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~qze/math601s20/hw3.pdf) Retractions, Borsuk-Ulam Theorem, Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, Vector Fields and Fixed Points

[HW 4 Computing fundamental groups](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~qze/math601s20/hw4.pdf)

[Homework 5 Covering space revisited](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~qze/math601s20/hw5.pdf)

[Homework 6 More Covering space](https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~qze/math601s20/hw6.pdf)

### Math 500 Topology （Fall 2019)
**Instructor:** *Leandro Lichtenfelz*

**Course description**: This course covers point-set and algebraic topology. In point-set topology, we generalize the ideas of open sets, continuity, connectedness and compactness from analysis. Topology can be viewed as qualitative geometry; rather than paying attention to distances, curvature, and other quantitative properties of a space, we study the connectedness of the space, whether it has "holes," and so on. In algebraic topology, we build tools for converting problems in topology, where there is little structure, into problems in algebra, where there is a lot of structure.

**Office hours**: By appointments

**Office lolation**: DRL 3C15

**Topics covered:** Point set topology: metric spaces and topological spaces, compactness, connectedness, continuity, extension theorems, separation axioms, quotient spaces, topologies on function spaces, Tychonoff theorem. Algebraic topology: Fundamental groups and covering spaces, and related topics.
